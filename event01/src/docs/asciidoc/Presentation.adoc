== What is Docs as Code?

TODO


== What does it have to do with DevOps?

Anne Gentle gives a nice answer to that

```
Docs like code :=

* write 
* review 
* test 
* merge 
* build 
* deploy 

repeat
```

=== Sounds familiar?
* Right, just like the concept of DevOps and CI/CD
* You *write* code eh docs ( as code )
* Let someone *review* it -> cross-reviews before merging -> merge request
* Run automated *tests* -> checkstyle, syntax etc.
* *Merge* stuff to (git) branch
* Run one or multiple *builds* for different formats
* And finally *deploy* the documents, e.g. to a html page, Confluence


== What tools can be used?
We want a simple code structure, choose a designated language for your project, e.g. AsciiDoc

Editing tools:

* Simple text editor like vim, notepad++, ...
WYSIWYG-tools
* rich text editor like Atom
* *IDEs*  `!!! Jippie !!!`
** IntelliJ (see `demo`)
** Visual Studio Code
** (Eclipse)

== Text document formats
designated languages

* Markdown .md (git)
* AsciiDoc .adoc (see `demo`)
* ...

=== And diagrams?
Diagrams can also be coded but that's is not that easy
Tools like _plantUML_ generate good sequential diagrams
but not for  "beautiful" graphics

Recommendation
s create diagrams, graphs, images somewhere else and reference to the files
-> stay up-to-date

=== What is AsciiDoc(tor)?

[quote, Stuart Rackham]
You write an AsciiDoc document the same way you would write a normal text document.
There are no markup tags or weird format notations.
AsciiDoc files are designed to be viewed, edited and printed directly or translated to other presentation formats.


== Examples

* Editing tools:
** Notepad++
** IntelliJ
* Docs:
** Code in Asciidoc format
** Generated documents
*** html
*** PDF

(comment this out)
* CI/CD Pipeline:
** Version control systems
*** gitLab (GFT)
** Build server:
*** Jenkins
** Generator
*** Asciidoctor
