//TODO: Write a paragraph
//*Hello* and _welcome_ to our first
//`DevOps Community Event`


////
In this `demo`
you learn how to write a *simple document*.
Sentences can be spread
cover several lines.
A good _pratice_ is to write one sentence at a line.
This helps to see changes in document versions.

////
Now let's have a look at some nice features.
(This is a new paragraph by the way.)
Unfortunately, syntax highlighting is not supported in the preview. :(
